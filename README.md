Are you watching this talk live? Is Katie currently up on stage explaining things to you?

**Then please don't read ahead and spoil the answers**

This resource is provided to you to help you learn, but it's no fun if I ask you to raise your hand to guess the answers when you ahave the answer key in front of you. 

Enjoy the talk. Read this later.

PS and FYI: you may have gotten to this page from a number of different iterations of this talk. This repo serves as a catch-all for all talk variants, and may reference things that weren't included in the version of the talk you watched/attended. 

## All examples are now interactively testable!

By the power of Docker!*

<small>* you need to have Docker installed</small>

For any of the languages in this directory: 

```shell
$ ./launch LANGAUGE
```

For example, want to check out the Ruby example? 

```shell
$ ./launch ruby
```

This will run the Dockerfile in the ruby directory, and land you in a shell where you can work with Ruby!

Most examples are interactive terminals, but some compile and execute sample code. 

All language folder READMEs also include information about how to use homebrew on macOS to run the same examples, and also additional resources, references, links, and explanations as to all the wats. 

They also run a 'motd': a little bash script that shows: 
 * the language version you're running
 * a reminder of where the README is
 * one or more of the examples covered. 

This runs *inside* docker, so it can live-introspect the environment. 

I will be trying my hardest to keep this repository up to date, but really all being said, getting to see the talk in person is fair more entertaining than reading a repo :)
