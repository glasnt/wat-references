# Implicit Type Coercion

> The `-` operator is defined only for numeric subtraction, so [4 - "2"] forces ["2"]'2 value to be coerced to a number

```
> 4 + "2"
42
```

> According to the ES5 spec, section 11.6.1, the + algorithm (when an object
> value is an operand) will concatenate if either operand is either already a
> string ...


```
> 1 == "1"
True

# Object destructuring

Specifically, variable name-based object destructuring (if you use object syntax and the value name matches the key in the object, you can get partial, declared assignment. )

```
const myobject = {
    a: "apple",
    b: "banana",
    c: "cherry",
    d: "dessert"
};


var { a } = myobject;
console.log(a)  // "apple"

var {b, c} = myobject
console.log(b, c) // "banana cherry"

var a = myobject
console.log(a) // full object (needs braces to work)

```
